# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

## Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to follow

1. Download the zip file from the web.
2. Load features.txt and activity_labels.txt.
3. Cleaning up the variable names. To do this, extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Load the other datasets.
5. Naming columns for the imported data.
6. Create the final test set by merging the xTest, yTest and subjectTest data.
7. Create the final test set by merging the xTest, yTest and subjectTest data.
8. Create the final  dataset by merging the DataTrain and DataTest data.
9. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
10. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
